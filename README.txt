                programs for using API of voip.ms service

Description:
------------
    This set of programs uses a config file to supply authentication information to
    use the API of the VOIP service at voip.ms.  There is an included example config
    file that needs to have the userid and password changed, and the file installed
    into your HOME directory.  You can tweak the config file to set which fields 
    you are interested in, the order and size of the fields, and the titles.


programs:
---------

    * black-list
    * get-cdrs
    * get-did-info
    * send-sms-message

Installation:
-------------

    To install from downloading from Github:

        make install        # install programs
        make man            # install man-pages

    To install from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

        pip install voip-ms-moxad


Example usages:
---------------
    This will print CDR records from November 11 to November 22, in reverse order
    such that records will be numbered from oldest to newest:

        % get-cdrs --from 2017-11-15 --to 2017-11-22 --reverse

    This will print last months CDR records and the cost for account 'home':

        % get-cdrs --last-month --cost --account home

    This will print the filter rules along with filter IDs to make changes to an existing rule:

        % black-list

    This will set a filter rule giving a Busy signal instead of the default NoService message:

        % black-list --note 'Bad Evil Dudes' --busy  416-555-1212 

    This will change the previous filter rule from Busy to Hangup instead:

        % black-list --hangup --filterid 12345


    This will send a SMS message to barney (an alias set up in the config file):

        % send-sms-message -r barney Time for a beer

    This will print all data about each DID, with the phone-number preceded by the (sub)account-name

        % get-did-info --account --all

    There is a help option with each program.  For eg:

        % get-cdrs --help
