        - scripts/get-cdrs:
          - wrap a separate try/except clause around trying to open a

        - added 'REQUIREMENTS' to MANIFEST.in

0.5     Dec 19, 2019
        - black-list, send-sms-message, get-did-info, get-cdrs
          - refactored.
          - fixed handling of config_file setting.
        - black-list, get-did-info, get-cdrs
          - separate main() function created, so much fewer globals
        - send-sms-message:
          - if callerID given, add entry using defaults if no options given
        - get-did-info:
          - changed -D/--did option to -l/--line to be consistent with
            other programs
          - created send_request() to handle lookup
          - created usage()
        - get-cdrs:
          - fixed typo in usage for -t option (was -T instead of -t)

0.6     July 16, 2020
        - scripts/*
          - defer printing usage until after proper config file resolved
          - end with error if it can't get HOME environment variable
          - dprint() now prepends debug strings with 'debug: '
          - overhauled how it finds its config.  It will use the last
            config file that exists, in the order of:
                    ${HOME}/.voip-ms.conf
                    environment variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE
                    given by option -c/--config
            The intention is that if you have your config, which has
            authentication info, in a mountable encrypted vault, that
            the commands are only useable when you have mounted that
            decrypted vault, say on a laptop, but if your laptop gets
            stolen, that voip.ms authentication info is safely encrypted.
            You can best iumplement that by using the environment
            variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE instead of having to supply
            the option -c/--config each time
        - doc/man/man1/black-list.1, doc/man/man1/get-cdrs.1,
          doc/man/man1/get-did-info.1, doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1:
            - add ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section
