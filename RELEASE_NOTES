        initial version

0.2     May 6, 2018
        - scripts/get-cdrs:
          - wrap a separate try/except clause around trying to open a
            connection to catch all exceptions so it doesn't explode, printing
            out the whole URL - which includes the userid and password.

0.3     Dec 14, 2019
        Created send-sms-message, which is option compatible with the Perl
        version in the Perl-voip.ms package at github.com/rjwhite/Perl-voip.ms
        and uses the same (copied) man page.

        - scripts/send-sms-message:
          - written
        - .voip-ms.conf
          - added 'sms' section
        - doc/man/man1/black-list.1:
        - doc/man/man1/get-cdrs.1:
        - doc/man/man1/get-did-info.1:
          - added send-sms-message(1)
        - doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1
          - created
        - RELEASE_NOTES:
          - formatting changes
        - setup.py:
          - updated 'version'
          - added scripts/send-sms-message to 'scripts'
        - README.md, README.txt:
          - added example for send-sms-message
        - MANIFEST.in:
          - added doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1

0.4     Dec 16, 2019
        - made all scripts Python 3 compliant.
        - more error handling.  Some refactoring.
        - more useful info provided if config or requests modules can not
          be imported
        - added 'sdist' target to Makefile
        - added REQUIREMENTS
        - added 'REQUIREMENTS' to MANIFEST.in

0.5     Dec 19, 2019
        - black-list, send-sms-message, get-did-info, get-cdrs
          - refactored.
          - fixed handling of config_file setting.
        - black-list, get-did-info, get-cdrs
          - separate main() function created, so much fewer globals
        - send-sms-message:
          - if callerID given, add entry using defaults if no options given
        - get-did-info:
          - changed -D/--did option to -l/--line to be consistent with
            other programs
          - created send_request() to handle lookup
          - created usage()
        - get-cdrs:
          - fixed typo in usage for -t option (was -T instead of -t)

0.6     July 16, 2020
        - scripts/*
          - defer printing usage until after proper config file resolved
          - end with error if it can't get HOME environment variable
          - dprint() now prepends debug strings with 'debug: '
          - overhauled how it finds its config.  It will use the last
            config file that exists, in the order of:
                    ${HOME}/.voip-ms.conf
                    environment variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE
                    given by option -c/--config
            The intention is that if you have your config, which has
            authentication info, in a mountable encrypted vault, that
            the commands are only useable when you have mounted that
            decrypted vault, say on a laptop, but if your laptop gets
            stolen, that voip.ms authentication info is safely encrypted.
            You can best implement that by using the environment
            variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE instead of having to supply
            the option -c/--config each time
        - doc/man/man1/black-list.1, doc/man/man1/get-cdrs.1,
          doc/man/man1/get-did-info.1, doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1:
            - add ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section

0.7     Mar 13, 2022
        - added options -t/--timeout and -s/--show-aliases to send-sms-message
        - updated doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1  to show new options

0.8     Oct 12, 2023
        COMPLETE OVERHAUL and change of installation target directory

        The entire package has been reorganized to utilize modern best
        practices for Python packaging and distribution.  Programs have now
        been changed to be modules using the main() function as an entry
        point for wrapper programs that import and call them.  They are
        no longer using setup() and disttools, but instead has pip as the
        front-end for a build, and uses a back-end of hatching, as defined in
        the pyproject.toml file.

        Each program (module), under src/voip_ms_moxad, now has a --timeout
        option which can over-ride any timeout value found in the config file.
        There is much better handling of values, going from defaults, then
        the config-file, and then finally command-line options.

        A lot of refactoring and eliminating long lines in the code for 
        better readability.

        If Python virtual environments are not being used, then the default
        destination directory will be the standard Python location of:
            ${HOME}/.local/bin
        which should be added to your PATH.

        All the functions from the programs (modules) have now been moved
        to functions.py - except for usage() and main() in each program.
        This eliminates a lot of code duplication - mostly from the common
        functions to each program of dprint(), find_config_file() and 
        send_request()

        There is now a globals.py (containing progname and debug_flag)
        and a constants.py - used by anything using format_date()

        The programs (modules) no longer attempt to be Python2 compatible.
        If you're running Python2, run an earlier version of this code.
        I think it's time to let go of Python2 for relatively modern code.

        To see why the dependancies in pyproject.toml are pruned and version
        vague compared to requirements.txt, see file info/failing-on-TestPyPI
